        "abstract": "Virtually all individuals aged 65 or older develop at least early pathology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), yet most lack disease-causing mutations in APP, PSEN, or MAPT, and many do not carry the APOE4 risk allele. This raises questions about AD development in the general population. Although transcriptional dysregulation has not traditionally been a hallmark of AD, recent studies reveal signi\ufb01cant epigenomic changes in late-onset AD (LOAD) patients. We show that altered expression of the LOAD biomarker phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) modulates AD pathology in mice and human brain organoids independent of its enzymatic activity. PHGDH has an uncharacterized role in transcriptional regulation, promoting the transcription of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKKa) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in astrocytes, which suppress autophagy and accelerate amyloid pathology. A blood-brain-barrier-permeable small-molecule inhibitor targeting PHGDH\u2019s transcriptional function reduces amyloid pathology and improves ADrelated behavioral de\ufb01cits. These \ufb01ndings highlight transcriptional regulation in LOAD and suggest therapeutic strategies beyond targeting familial mutations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Generative deep learning is reshaping drug design. Chemical language models (CLMs) \u2013 which generate molecules in the form of molecular strings \u2013 bear particular promise for this endeavor. Here, we introduce a recent deep learning architecture, termed Structured State\u00a0Space Sequence (S4) model, into de novo drug design. In addition to its unprecedented performance in various fields, S4 has shown remarkable capabilities to learn the global properties of sequences. This aspect is intriguing in chemical language modeling, where complex molecular properties like bioactivity can \u2018emerge\u2019 from separated portions in the molecular string. This observation gives rise to the following question: Can S4 advance chemical language modeling for de novo design? To provide an answer, we systematically benchmark S4 with state-of-the-art CLMs on an array of drug discovery tasks, such as the identification of bioactive compounds, and the design of drug-like molecules and natural products. S4 shows a superior capacity to learn complex molecular properties, while at the same time exploring diverse scaffolds. Finally, when applied prospectively to kinase inhibition, S4 designs eight of out ten molecules that are predicted as highly active by molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, these findings advocate for the introduction of S4 into chemical language modeling \u2013 uncovering its untapped potential in the molecular sciences.",

Here we use deep network hallucination to generate a wide range of symmetric protein homo-oligomers given only a specification of the number of protomers and the protomer length. Crystal structures of 7 designs are very close to the computational models (median RMSD: 0.6 \u00c5), as are 3 cryoEM structures of giant 10 nanometer rings with up to 1550 residues and C33 symmetry; all differ considerably from previously solved structures. Our results highlight the rich diversity of new protein structures that can be generated using deep learning, and pave the way for the design of increasingly complex components for nanomachines and biomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Natural Medicinal Materials (NMMs) have a long history of global clinical applications and a wealth of records and knowledge. Although NMMs are a major source for drug discovery and clinical application, the utilization and sharing of NMM knowledge face crucial challenges, including the standardized description of critical information, efficient curation and acquisition, and language barriers. To address these, we developed ShennongAlpha, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven sharing and collaboration platform for intelligent knowledge curation, acquisition, and translation. For standardized knowledge curation, the platform introduced a Systematic Nomenclature to enable accurate differentiation and identification of NMMs. More than fourteen thousand Chinese NMMs have been curated into the platform along with their knowledge. Furthermore, the platform pioneered chat-based knowledge acquisition, standardized machine translation, and collaborative knowledge updating. Together, our study represents the first major advance in leveraging AI to empower NMM knowledge sharing, which not only marks a novel application of AI for science, but also will significantly benefit the global biomedical, pharmaceutical, physician, and patient communities.",
